# OpenEuropa Typed Link Field

The module servers a link field with type options. These options can be anything, social media types or others.
The module can be used to create fields with social media icons based on social media types, for example.
This module provides the typed link field type, as well as a default widget and formatter.
It provides a basic twig template for rendering, but it is meant to be overridden by the OpenEuropa Theme which provides
the Europa Component Library (ECL) component.

The field has the following properties:
* Type: The type of the link
* URL: The url of the link.
* Title: title of the link.
